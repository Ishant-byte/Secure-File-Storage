Overview
Secure File Storage is a Python-based application designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for storing and managing files. The system uses AES-256 encryption to protect files and OTP-based authentication to ensure secure user login. It is built with a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

Key Features
Secure User Authentication: OTP-based login for enhanced security.

File Encryption: Files are encrypted using AES-256 before being stored.

File Management: Users can upload, download, hide, unhide, and delete files.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter for a simple and intuitive experience.

Database Integration: Uses MySQL to store user information and file metadata.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Tkinter (for GUI)

PyCryptodome (for AES-256 encryption)

PyOTP (for OTP generation and verification)

mysql-connector-python (for MySQL database integration)

Database: MySQL

Tools: XAMPP (for local MySQL server setup)

Future Improvements
Cloud Integration: Add support for cloud storage (e.g., AWS, Google Drive).

Multi-Factor Authentication: Implement additional authentication methods for enhanced security.

File Compression: Add file compression to optimize storage and encryption speed.

Mobile Compatibility: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application.
